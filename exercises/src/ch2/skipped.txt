- Ex3 -> too similar to previous exercises, no new value

- Ex4 -> same as above

- Ex5 -> while different, the concept is the same:
    -- grab the values from Scanner and use next to get each
    -- do simple calculation and print results

- Ex6 -> similar to above but the mod and floating point division
    -- grab single value from Scanner
    -- do % and / to get at each digit, add them all together
    -- print to standard output
